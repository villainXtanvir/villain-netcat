# villain-netcat
The Villain Netcat Tool is a versatile Python-based network utility designed for penetration testing, debugging, and managing network connections. It functions similarly to the traditional netcat tool, allowing users to establish TCP connections, transfer files, execute commands remotely, and interact with a command shell over a network.
